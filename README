CS-575 Final Project

To be able to run the Node application, a PostgreSQL Database should be running and connected to the app via a connectionString. The app.js file currently has the information of my PostgreSQL DB, but if you want to run this project, here's the format of the PostgreSQL Database:

Tables:
-users
-messages

users:
Contains all the information of the players
Format:
[username: text, password: text, friends: text, prestige: integer]

messages:
Contains all data of all messages sent by players
Format:
[id: int, sender: text, receiver: text, subject: text, message: text, time: time/hour, date: date]


Also, the GAME SERVER application should be running as well on the same machine running the Node application. The server can be found in the server/ folder. It can be run by using the command:

python3 server.py

Python 3, websockets and asyncio is required. The installation of websockets can be found in: server/WebSocket/
